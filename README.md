PortfolioSite20122013
=====================

Old portfolio site design with HTML5 Boilerplate, responsive design, and some custom jQuery (e.g. grid parsing XML to display rain drops falling from clouds)

Can be found at http://ericbarber.me/oldsite

Code is mixed with other sites due to bad FTP pushes, etc. Generally messy - better off inspecting the site itself to see the going-ons. Site.js in particular has some pretty amateur code - first 'real' jQuery project but no excuses!

Redesign in process, awaiting iOS7 application development & approval.
